Github tutorial for newbie tigers

Hi! I'm Panthera tigris or Tiger for short. I learnt how to code at University a long time ago and never really got to code after that. I roamed the world and now that I am finally settled, I've decided it's about time to put these paws to good use. I'm learning javascript with the nice people at Constructor Labs who thought it would be a good idea to learn how to use Github. So here we are. 

Roar.
